# InfoSec Black Friday Deals ~ "Hack Friday" 2023 Edition
All the deals for InfoSec related software/tools this Black Friday / Cyber Monday, for all the hackers that saved $8 on blue and got a free :see_no_evil: instead.

This list is for you if you are in: all the cyberz, penetration tester, blue team, red team, purple team, secure code, exploit research and development, vulnerability management, threat hunting, incident response, forensics, intelligence, threat intelligence, open-source intelligence, governance/risk/compliance, security architect, network security, CSO/CISO, AppSec, DevSecOps, consulting, security awareness, and -insert your role here-

The below deals have either publicly announced they'll be doing a deal or highly expected.
- All USD
- All End times in UTC
- DYOR and AYOR: I have not vetted links for legitimacy
- Some vendors use my handle for tracking this list - there are **NO** referral/affiliate/commission links here

## FAQ

### When will most of the deals/discounts be here?
Most likely 24th midday, but some start before, so check back often!

### When do these sales end?
Most end 30th November

### Can I add deals to the page?
Yes, please follow formatting guidelines, provide a source and code. Has to be infosec related, no affiliate links, deal has to be active or a waitlist.  

:see_no_evil: means 1) Limited to first x users 2) Great deal or 3) Highly recommended by moi
