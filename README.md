# InfoSec Black Friday Deals ~ "Cyber Turducken" 2025 Edition
All the deals for InfoSec related software/tools this coming Black Friday. 

Prepare thy corporate amex card. Prepare ye' team budget request forms. It's time to load up on InfoSec tools and get the deals that only pop up once a year. We've experienced the Crowdstrike outage and ChatGPT since 2023, I think we all deserve a little break. 

### Just 2025 things
Quality over quantity - this list goes through a level of vetting for dodginess, gated-deals, deals that aren't infosec related and either can't be verified or break promises. There are also some vendors being stood up (literally) with courses and training 'just' for black friday; at your service here to weed out the genuine from the fake.

This list is for you if you are in: all teh cyberz, penetration tester, blue team, red team, purple team, secure code, exploit research and development, vulnerability management, threat hunting, incident response, forensics, intelligence, threat intelligence, open-source intelligence, governance/risk/compliance, security architect, network security, CSO/CISO, AppSec, DevSecOps, consulting, security awareness, and -insert your role here-

The below deals have either announced a deal, highly expected, or shared through smoke signals to yours truly.
- All USD
- All end times in UTC
- DYOR and AYOR: I try my best to vet all links for legitimacy, but there's always a chance something slips through
