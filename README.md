# InfoSec Black Friday & Cyber Monday Deals ~ "InfoSec Cares" 2025 Edition
All the deals for InfoSec related software/tools this coming Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

## ALL LINKS UPDATED FOR 2025! Many more incoming...

### Quick Personal Update
After being involved in a car accident and everything going sideways just before November, I'm floored by the care. So many in InfoSec reached out, and kudos to the legend **wwwiesel** (https://github.com/wwwiesel/InfoSec-Black-Friday) for pushing out a substitute repo. By all means, feel free to use that list given their efforts! I won't be duplicating/copying from it, as some old deals, non-vetted items have slipped through, lacks formatting, and so I've been manually re-verifying all deals.

I'm now able to give it my all, so hope you will find this useful. I will nominate another repo owner (wwwiesel get in touch?) to mitigate delays in the future.

### Just 2025 things
I vet things - hard. Quality over quantity. These codes **work**. I remove one-time dodgy deals, gated-deals, deals that aren't infosec related and either can't be verified or break promises. At your service here to weed out the genuine from the fake. I test out each and every single BF discount claim.

If a deal offers more than 90% off or now $100 from $1000+, it may be inflated or price distortion/manipulation. Stay alert!

This list is for you if you are in: all teh cyberz, penetration tester, blue team, red team, purple team, secure code, exploit research and development, vulnerability management, threat hunting, incident response, forensics, intelligence, threat intelligence, open-source intelligence, governance/risk/compliance, security architect, network security, CSO/CISO, AppSec, DevSecOps, consulting, security awareness, and -insert your role here-

The below deals have either announced a deal, highly expected, or shared through smoke signals to yours truly.
- All USD
- All end times in UTC
- DYOR and AYOR: I try my best to vet all links for legitimacy and being malware-free, but there's always a chance something slips through

## VENDORS
I have created a comprehensive guide of lessons learned for all the years of putting together this list. If you'd like a copy, please get in touch via mike@monnik.io.
