# InfoSec Black Friday Deals ~ "Friday Hack Fest" 2023 Edition
All the deals for InfoSec related software/tools this Black Friday / Cyber Monday. 

I was a little late getting started with my wife pushing out a little 0-day baby as of today. Thank you CriimBow for kicking things off in the meantime! 

### Just 2023 things
Quality over quantity - this list goes through a level of vetting for dodginess, gated-deals, deals that aren't infosec related and either can't be verified or break promises (e.g. states % off all courses, but has exclusions). There are also some vendors being stood up (literally) with courses and training 'just' for black friday; at your service here to weed out the genuine from the fake.

This list is for you if you are in: all teh cyberz, penetration tester, blue team, red team, purple team, secure code, exploit research and development, vulnerability management, threat hunting, incident response, forensics, intelligence, threat intelligence, open-source intelligence, governance/risk/compliance, security architect, network security, CSO/CISO, AppSec, DevSecOps, consulting, security awareness, and -insert your role here-

The below deals have either publicly announced they'll be doing a deal or highly expected.
- All USD
- All End times in UTC
- DYOR and AYOR: I try my best to vet all links for legitimacy, but there's always a chance something slips through
- Some vendors use my handle for tracking this list - there are **NO** referral/affiliate/commission links here

## FAQ

### When will most of the deals/discounts be recorded here?
Most likely 24th midday, but some start on Monday, so check back often!

### When do these sales start?
Most start around the 20th November

### When do these sales end?
Most end 30th November

### Can I add deals to the page?
Yes, please follow formatting guidelines, provide a source and code. Has to be infosec related, no affiliate links, deal has to be active or a waitlist.

:see_no_evil: means 1) Limited to first x users 2) Great deal or 3) Highly recommended by moi

*Disclaimer: I have included my own, and other discount codes sent in directly by DM/Pigeon/Smoke signals.
